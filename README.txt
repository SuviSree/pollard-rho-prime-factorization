This project contains a description and various implementations (python2, python3, java) of Pollard's rho algorithm to factor integers.

The python file pollard-rho-factorization.py is written for python3.  
For the python2 implementation (minor changes), use pollard-rho-factorization-python2.py.
The .pdf is a description of Pollard's rho algorithm.
